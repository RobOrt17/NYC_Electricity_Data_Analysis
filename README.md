For this project, my data source came from the following: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-consumption-and-cost-2010-april-2020

This was my first time utilizing Power BI and finding my own outside of class data source. This dashboard analysis looks at the price per KWH in the 5 boroughs of NYC's developments.
